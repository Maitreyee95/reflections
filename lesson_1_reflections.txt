How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    picks out lines between the two versions that has been modified

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could go back to the version which I think is better than the current one

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:i could manually choose to save versions which is more logical
    Cons: Have to do it by myself
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To save changes in all the files in the folder in a commit allows us to see the interrelated changes done in them.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all the commits in repository. git diff shows the differences betwee two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    using git checkout previous versions could be restored,which doesnt have the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for version-control and accessing github
